A book writeen by co-founder of PayPal, which was bought by Ebay.

A company who can dominate the market is the one who created services and products from zero to one, which means from non-exist to exist. Novelty is a misleading word as it could be the from zero to one, or incremental. The company who has this ability usually can plan long term investment for more creative products or services as they have much cash flow, also without competitors to spare cash and energy. Like Google, the searching service created dominate the 80% of the market in USA, and this makes its position untouchable. The domainant postion also bring great cash flow in terms of online advertisement.

Creating successful startups like to find the secrets which has markets but not found by the others, like facebook which connect the people, uber utilizing the extra resources of private cars, and airbnb with private properties. To make it bigger, you need find a point which can quickly domainate the market and then spread it. Like paypal, the point is to cooperate with ebay to provide services for their customers which have strong needs better payment except cheque and credit cards.
